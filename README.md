## Ethereum is world's first open source decentralized platform that runs on the (EVM) Ethereum virtual machine. It's world's first programmable blockchain by using smart contract, which you could build (dapps) decentralized applications on it. Ethereum let's anyone to sent cryptocurrency to anyone for a small fee and it's the first applicaiton that everyone can use and no one could take it down. It's the marketplace of apps, games and financial services that no one could steal data from you.

* Ethereum was created July 30,2015 

* Founder: Vitalik Buterin

* The idea of smart contract 

* Ethereum was decribed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin

* Etherem was founded by online public crowsale from July to August 2014

## Business activities

* Ethereum is the world first decentralized programmble blockchain that could solve many financial problem like borrow, lending, yield etc...

* Ethereum is aim for everyone to used and eventually people could live in a bankless world that everyone could particpte, no matter what race, country or personal status. It's solving so much problem by using smart contracts. It's such a unfair advantage they utilize by using the open sources platform.

* Ethereum is mostly written in Python, Go, C++, Rust, Java. The smart contract on the platform is written in solidity and it all implemeting on blockchain.

## Landscape

* The domain of the Ethereum is in a lot of things because it's so new and evolving so fast that for now it's overed in Defi, NFTs, and just pretty much anything that could run on smart contracts.  

* Dencentralized application has been trending for the past 4-5 years. Decentralized autonomous organization with decentralized finace has been major trends in the past year. Now that NFTs (Non-fungible token) has been trending for the past couple month.

* Ubisoft, ING bank, and Ameritrade are all using and testing in this domain.

## Results

* It has change the bussiness forever. For example, NFTs has made arts, music, gaming world will never be the same for the first in history that you can authenticated everything you can make. Whether is a song, a film or a fornite skins. You can now really own a digital item. Defi just starting to take off last year and already have so many brrow and lending protocol that are being use seemly. 

* They are some similat platform trying to be ethereum but base law of network effect it's really not coming close to ether. There is a little bump with some of the ethereum scaling issues but the core metrics to measure sucess is network effect at the end and ethereum is dminating.

## Recommendations

* The only thing I would offer the dev team for ether is to do more advertising, I believe the idea of smart contract alone should pull more people to work on this project and innovate more for the ethereum ecosystem.

* It will benefit Ethereum like the network effect and more people are going to discover this amazing technology.

* There will be many more protocal that can be build on top of this platform that are using smart contract and it's a endless number of financial products that are using this techology.

* This technology is not just appropriate for my solution it's for everyones. It will solve so many problem in this world using smart contracts. There are some many unproductive middle man in the world of bussiness and contracts and Ethereum is the solution to all of that.
